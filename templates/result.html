<h3>Clinical experts use a variety of tests to diagnose fungal diseases. The specific tests conducted depend on the suspected fungal infection and the patient's symptoms. Some common fungal disease tests include:</h3><li><strong>Microscopic Examination:</strong><ul><strong>Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Preparation:</strong>This test involves placing a sample of the affected tissue or fluid in a solution of potassium hydroxide. The solution breaks down cells, leaving fungal elements more visible under a microscope.</ul></li><li>Fungal Culture: A sample of the infected tissue or fluid is cultured on a special medium to encourage the growth of fungi. This helps identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection.</li><li>Antibody Detection: Some fungal infections trigger the production of specific antibodies, which can be detected in the blood. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a common method for this purpose.</li>
<!-- 
Culture Tests:

Fungal Culture: A sample of the infected tissue or fluid is cultured on a special medium to encourage the growth of fungi. This helps identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection.
Molecular Tests:

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): PCR can detect and amplify specific DNA sequences of fungi, aiding in the identification of the pathogen.
Serological Tests:

Antibody Detection: Some fungal infections trigger the production of specific antibodies, which can be detected in the blood. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a common method for this purpose.
Radiological Imaging:

X-rays, CT scans, or MRI: Imaging studies can reveal the presence of fungal infections in bones, sinuses, or other internal organs.
Skin Tests:

Skin Prick Test: Used for certain fungal allergies, this test involves pricking the skin with a tiny amount of fungal allergen and observing for an allergic reaction.
Blood Tests:

Complete Blood Count (CBC): Elevated white blood cell count can indicate an infection, including fungal infections.
C-reactive protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): These markers may be elevated in the presence of inflammation, which can be caused by fungal infections.
Biopsy:

Tissue Biopsy: In some cases, a small sample of infected tissue is surgically removed and examined under a microscope to identify the type of fungus causing the infection. -->
